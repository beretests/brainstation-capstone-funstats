# Project Title

FunStats

## Overview

FunStats is an app for kids who play soccer to add their stats and compare them to their friends, and also possibly set stat goals to earn rewards.

### Problem

Kids who play soccer (or any other sport for that matter) are typically competitive and often compare their stats with friends (or even siblings) who are players on their team, or other teams especially if they go to the same school. They usually have to rely on their memory (which can sometimes lead to conflict) as most sport teams use apps with features that are mainly focused on scheduling games and practices, as well as updating the whole team stats (games won and games lost). They do not have robust features for individual players to view and update their stats. The kids will not only be able to compare their stats with their friends, this will also help to boost their motivation to keep playing as they observe their skills progressively improve.

### User Profile

- Kid soccer players:
  - looking to be able to view and update their game season stats
  - looking to compare their stats with friends
  - looking to earn/give rewards as the stats improve

### Features

- As a player, I want to be able to create an account to manage my stats
- As a player, I want to be able to login to my account to manage my stats
- As a logged in player, I want to be able to view, update and/or add new stats after each game
- As a logged in player, a modal with a famous soccer player's image and stats is displayed each time I add a new stat giving the opportunity to earn points if I can guess his name correctly.
- As a logged in player, I want to be able to add other players as friends
- As a logged in player, I want to be able to compare my stats to a friend's
